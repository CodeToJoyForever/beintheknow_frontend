# Be In The Know (BKnow)

## Description
Many people are not aware of situations where they could make a difference. This might be because they do not have social media accounts or the time to keep on top of current events. *In The Know* makes it easy for users to not only be aware of important events, but to also become part of the change the world needs.

It is an interactive application that allows users to get the word out of important causes, catastrophes, or achievements. It allows users to contribute.

The **back-end** complement of this repo lives [here](https://github.com/CodeToJoyForever/BeInTheKnow_backend).

## Built With

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - version 16.9.0

## Plans
Please see the dev-log file.
